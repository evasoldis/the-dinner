    <p class="question">
      Could you start by telling me a bit about your work 
      at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs?
    </p>

    <p class="A">

    <p class="answer">
      I was the protocol director there for several years, 
      which involved organizing dinner parties among other 
      things. At the embassy, I have of course also experienced 
      how dinner parties can be useful for bringing people together 
      and to pave the way for cooperation. Such functions can 
      strengthen connections between individuals who may later 
      have more substantial matters to discuss and can then do 
      so after having gotten to know each other a bit. Dinner 
      can then serve as an ice breaker and make it easier for 
      them to have further interactions.

    <p class="answer">
      Organising dinner parties for example. What has proven very 
      important in such organisation is arranging seating for guests 
      — both choosing to seat together people who you think will benefit 
      from or enjoy meeting each other, and also to place those near 
      each other who you think have similar interests. You should at 
      least ensure that there is no animosity between those who you seat 
      together, so that they don't feel uncomfortable close to each other.

    <p class="question">
      Having your experience of protocol direction, have you ever 
      attended dinner and thought: “this could have been organised better?”
    </p>

    <p class="A">
      A
    </p>
    
    <p class="answer">
      Yes, I can share an instance from a banquet for heads of state 
      at Hotel Saga in Reykjavík. The Secretary of State and I were 
      standing in the foyer where a seating chart had been displayed. 
      As one guest arrived, he greeted my colleague, who handed him his 
      seating card and explained where he would be sitting and next to whom. 
      The man suddenly straightened up, swung his hand in a way that grazed 
      my colleague's face, and declared, “I will not sit next to her,” 
      referring to the woman he had been seated beside.
    </p>

    <p class="answer-extra">
      Of course, by that point, nothing could be changed, but the Secretary 
      was understandably startled. I don't recall all the details, but we had 
      no indication that there was any prior conflict between these individuals 
      when the seating was arranged. It was the sort of background information 
      that would have been impossible to anticipate.

    <p class="question">
      Arranging a successful dinner seems quite challenging. 
      Are there many factors to consider?
    </p>


    <p class="A">
      A
    </p>
    
    <p class="answer">
      It certainly can be! I remember a time at the President's Office 
      when someone else had initially arranged the seating. When I was 
      asked to review and finalize it, I noticed an issue:  women of nearly 
      equal rank were seated together, but the arrangement subtly implied 
      that one was ranked higher than the other. I immediately realized this 
      could cause upset.
    </p>

    <p class="answer-extra">
      Even though the seating cards had already been printed, I made the 
      decision to have them completely reprinted to resolve this seemingly 
      small issue. It might sound trivial, but in the world of protocol, such 
      details matter greatly. These events are designed for people to enjoy 
      themselves, and something as minor as seating arrangements can have a 
      big impact.
    </p>

    <p class="answer-extra">
      Another example comes to mind from a dinner in Copenhagen, where one of the 
      guests was a doctor. During the evening, he noticed that another guest seemed unwell. 
      Concerned, they agreed to meet later in Reykjavík for further evaluation. It was during 
      this follow-up that the doctor diagnosed the early stages of Parkinson's disease. 
      That chance encounter at the dinner ultimately led to a vital medical connection, 
      likely changing the course of the guest's treatment and care.
    </p>

    <p class="answer-extra">
      I also recall a dinner in London where the embassy was working on resolving unpaid 
      debts owed to Icelandic creditors in Nigeria. I heard about a highly respected Nigerian 
      man living in London, admired for his position in their tribal hierarchy, and invited him 
      to the dinner. His presence had a remarkable impact. Those we were negotiating with showed 
      great respect for him, and his advocacy on our behalf significantly smoothed the negotiations 
      that followed. He was seated in a place of special honor due to his high standing and the esteem 
      of his tribe. The other Nigerian man, who had been difficult to deal with in this matter, suddenly 
      changed his tone entirely—he became very compliant and showed great deference.

      In the biography of Talleyrand, who was, among other things, Napoleon's 
      foreign minister, there's a story about his last official speech. It was 
      a eulogy for a man who had also served as France's foreign minister. In 
      this speech, Talleyrand described the qualities a foreign minister should 
      possess, many of which are desirable traits for others as well.
        </p>
    
     <p class="answer-extra">
      He spoke, for instance, about conversations, and I'd like to read this to you 
      in English from the book: “His conversations”—and here he's describing the ideal 
      foreign minister—“His conversation should be simple, varied, unexpected, always 
      natural, and sometimes naive.” I see here that I've bookmarked the passage.
     </p>
    
     <p class="answer-extra">
      Regarding the idea of being unexpected, I think I have a good example. It was at 
      a dinner in Belgium hosted by François de Rose, France's permanent representative 
      to NATO. He was highly esteemed and had been a member of France's nuclear council. 
      I once read an article in a renowned magazine where Henry Kissinger even quoted him.
     </p>
    
     <p class="answer-extra">
      At this particular dinner, after we'd finished eating, two or three of us were standing 
      near the piano with cups of coffee and glasses of cognac. De Rose joined us and asked, 
      “Have you ever considered that if we placed a mirror 1,000 light-years away in space, 
      we would now be seeing the birth of the Saviour?” [laughs]
     </p>

     <p class="answer-extra">
      It's an amusing thought—2,000 years after the approximate birth of Jesus. But I found 
      this to be a good example of something entirely unexpected, something that would never 
      have occurred to most people except for someone like him. In my view, this is very much 
      in the spirit of what Talleyrand advocated—surprising people with ideas or perspectives 
      that catch them off guard.

      Do you think that the art of conversation is of more importance in the

      It does play an incredibly important role, especially in relation to what you 
      mentioned about dinner parties as cultural phenomena and symbols of social dynamics, 
      customs, and human connections. These gatherings are, of course, unique opportunities 
      for people to meet—people from diverse backgrounds coming together to exchange ideas 
      about their daily pursuits. To make these occasions enjoyable, they need to follow the 
      principles Talleyrand spoke about: they should be varied and often include something 
      unexpected. For instance, I still remember that anecdote from 1973, which reflects this 
      idea perfectly.
     </p>
    
     <p class="answer-extra">
      The main thing is that people should truly enjoy themselves at such gatherings. 
      I also think about the arrangement of dinner parties and the role they play in 
      bringing people closer, providing them with stimulating content to reflect on. 
      This reminds me of Vilhjálmur Stefánsson, the Arctic explorer, who was one of 
      the most renowned figures of his time for his research on the northern regions. 
      There's even an island in northern Canada named Stefansson Island, as he spent 
      much of his life in Canada.
     </p>
    
     <p class="answer-extra">
      His wife once shared that he greatly enjoyed hosting gatherings but insisted on 
      keeping them small enough so that there could always be a single, unified conversation 
      at the table that everyone could participate in.

      It's hard for me to say definitively, as most of the people I interact with are 
      close to my age, not from the younger generations. However, it is very important, 
      especially when attending a gathering in another country, to be familiar with key 
      table manners. Missteps in etiquette can sometimes affect how others perceive you, 
      as people may form impressions based on how you conduct yourself at the table.

      Q
   </p>
  
    <p class="question">
      There seems to be quite a science behind all these customs. 
      Can you share some interesting etiquette traditions from other cultures?
    </p>
       
       
   <p class="A">
     A
    </p>
           
   <p class="answer">
    Absolutely, and these customs vary widely between countries. It's always 
    helpful to be familiar with them. For example, Queen Elizabeth had a particular 
    approach to conversation during meals. Rather than alternating between the guests 
    on her left and right throughout the meal, she would spend the first half speaking 
    to the guest on her left and the second half speaking to the guest on her right.
    </p>

    <p class="answer-extra">
    I once attended a luncheon where I was seated between her and Princess Margaret, 
    her sister. The Queen hosted this luncheon in honor of Vigdís Finnbogadóttir, and 
    at the time, I was Iceland's ambassador to London. The presidential secretary, Kornelíus 
    Sigfússon, was seated to her left, and I was seated to her right—a position that, 
    according to international protocol, holds greater honor. During the meal, the Queen 
    spoke with the secretary during the first half and then turned her attention to me 
    for the second half. Understanding these customs is important—it wasn't a slight against 
    me, just her way of doing things.
    </p>

    <p class="answer-extra">
    Protocol rules, such as seating arrangements, are especially significant 
    in formal settings. For instance, the seat to the host's right is the place 
    of highest honor, followed by the seat to their left, and then outward from 
    the host in descending order. These arrangements often reflect specific hierarchies. 
    In less formal gatherings, however, you can often create your own seating rules. 
    When there's no need to follow strict hierarchies, the key is to know your guests 
    well and thoughtfully arrange the seating so that people who would enjoy each other's 
    company are placed together.
